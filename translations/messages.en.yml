about.description: "Backend developer"
about.subdescription: "My name is Lukas, and I've been interested in computer science since childhood. Today, I focus on backend development for various types of applications (mainly REST APIs). I place the highest importance on security, code readability, and simplicity. I primarily work with PHP and prefer using the Symfony framework. I also have experience with frontend development using React, and I am an active Linux user and administrator. Recently, I've been intensively focusing on DevOps, containerization, application deployment, and I manage my own Raspberry Pi cluster, where I run Kubernetes for my side projects"
